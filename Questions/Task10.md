A) What is faster between selection sort and Insetion sort when the given array has been sorted?

- Insertion sort is a lot faster because it will only go over n elements once, and not two times.
  This is all pga. the while loop in insetion sort


B) What is faster between selection sort and Insetion sort when the given array has been sorted in reverse?

- Because Selection sort has to always go all the way back to find the smallest element, it will be take the longest time. However the order is close 

C) Are they stabe?

- Selection : Not stable, elements are swapped over eachother and will not be stable. 
- Insetion: Yes, because we only swap if the value is smaller then the current value. Therfore nothing will happen if to elements are the same
- Shell sort: No, because it does not care about the elements bewteen the intervals
